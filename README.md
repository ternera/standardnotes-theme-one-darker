# VS Code One Dark Darker theme for Standard Notes (updated 2025 version)

Theme for [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/). Based on VS Code and my personal version of the [One Dark Darker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JoelCrosby.one-dark-darker) theme.

This is not gauranteed to work perfectly as the Standard Notes application changes and evolves. Feel free to open an issue if you notice anything that needs to be fixed.
